Please read carefully the following guidelines. They will
help you to manage your account and your submission(s).

<p>
You must have an account to use this system. As an
user, you are uniquely identified by your <i>email</i>.
It can be changed, but the general rule in MyReview is
that there cannot exist two users with the same email.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Are you already registered as a user?</b> You may be already
known as a user, even if you are not aware of it. For instance:
<ol>
  <li>You are a reviewer for this event, and the administrator created an account for you.</li>
  <li>You already proposed a submission in the past, and your account still exists.</li>
  <li>You are an author of a submission create by another user.</li>
</ol>

Before creating an account you can <a href=\"{base_url}/index/checkaccount\">check whether
you are already registered</a>.

</p>
<p>
When your account is created, you can <a href=\"{base_url}/index/login\">log in the system</a>, 
<a href=\"{base_url}/author/submit\">submit one or several papers</a>, and
<a href=\"{base_url}/author/console\">manage your profile and the list or your submissions</a>.

<p>
Welcome to the <b>MyReview</b> web-based
conference management system! 
</p>

<h2>What is MyReview?</h2>

<p>
MyReview is a paper review system written with PHP and MySQL. It
proposes the traditional functionalities of such systems, 
namely paper submission, reviewer assignment, discussion
on conflicting reviews, selection of papers, mails sent to all actors,
etc.</p>

<p>
MyReview is distributed under the Gnu Public Library (GPL) Licence 
and has been used by hundreds of conferences. Version 2 is a complete revision
and brings several important features, including multi-languages support.</p>


<h2>Try it!</h2>

<a href=\"{base_url}/index/createaccount\">Create an account</a> and log
in the system. You can play with all the 
functionalities, taking alternatively the role
of the three main types of actors

<ol>
 <li><b>Authors</b>
   As an author, you can submit an abstract for a paper
    that you intend to submit, using the <a href=\"{base_url}/author/submit\">
   abstract submission interface</a>. </li>

 <li><b>Reviewers</b>
   As a reviewer, you can access the <a href=\"{base_url}/reviewer\">reviewing
   interface</a>, download your assigned papers, submit and update  your reviews.
   You need a login and a password: use 
     <b>myreview@lri.fr</b> and the password
     <b>myreview</b> for this demo.</li>

 <li><b>Administrator</b>
   This is the most important role. Using the <a href=\"{base_url}/admin\">administrator
   interface</a>  You can configure the system,
   create new reviewers, enter research topics, evaluation criterias,
   papers' status codes
   for your conference, ask reviewers to select their preferred topics,
   etc. The user
     <b>myreview@lri.fr</b> (with password
     <b>myreview</b>) is an administrator  for this demo site.</li>
</ol>
